# Lab Demonstration

In this section of the course, the instructor can walk students through the basic functionality of FME Workbench and FME Data Inspector. If your lab space permits it, students can follow along.

This content could instead be delivered as a lecture or as part of a lab, if the instructor prefers.

# Learning Objectives

Students will learn:

1. **FME Workbench** is an application to graphically define a translation and the flow of data within it. The definition of a translation is known as a workspace and can be saved to a file for later use.
2. **Quick translation** is the technique of carrying out a translation generated by FME, without further editing.
3. The **Generate Workspace** dialog is the main method by which a quick translation can be set up in FME Workbench.
4. Data inspection is a technique for checking and verifying data before, during, and after a translation. The **FME Data Inspector** is a tool for inspecting data.
6. A **schema** describes a datasetâ€™s structure, including its feature types, attributes, and geometries.
7. **Schema editing** is the act of editing the destination schema to better define what is required out of the translation.
8. The act of joining the source schema to the destination is called **schema mapping**. Differences between the two schemas lead to **structural transformation**.
9. **Content transformation** is the modifying of data content during a translation. In FME Workbench data transformation is carried out using objects called transformers.
10. **Transformers** are the building blocks used in FME Workbench. Each transformer has a specific function. They can be used alone in a simple workspace, or combined to create complicated processes.
11. **Group-by processing** is when FME transformers carry out transformations on a whole set of features at once, in contrast to **feature-based processing**, when transformations are carried out one feature at a time.
12. Working with spatial data requires setting and reprojecting data so they share a common **coordinate system**.
13. **Partial runs** allow you to only run part of a workspace, making debugging much easier.
14. FME Workbench users should follow **best practices** by using **annotations** and **bookmarks** to organize their workspaces so other users can understand them.
