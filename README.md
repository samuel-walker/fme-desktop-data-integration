# FME Desktop Training Module: Data Integration

This manual is an introductory-level training module for FME Desktop. It provides a framework for a basic understanding of FME and for using FME in data integration.

The training will introduce basic concepts and terminology, help students become efficient users of FME, and direct them to resources to help apply the product to their own needs.

## Module Structure

The module is made up of three main sections. These sections are:

- Lecture
- Lab Demonstration
- Lab Exercises

The **Lecture** section is intended to be adapted by instructors to be taught in a classroom lecture. It covers conceptual issues of data integration and provides a high-level introduction to FME. Slides are provided [here]().

The **Lab Demonstration** section provides a walkthrough of how to use FME and is designed to be taught by an instructor in a lab, with students optionally following along on their own computers.

Finally, the **Lab Exercises** section provides hands-on activities for students to complete during lab time or as assignments. It contains questions; instructors may access the answers for use in grading [here]().

## Module Audience

This module is aimed at a university or college student audience. Students should be comfortable with data manipulation software in a scripted or GUI application, e.g. CAD or GIS. Prior knowledge of FME is not required. If the instructor wishes to adapt the module to a higher level the lecture and lab demonstration content can be shortened.

## Module Length

This module is designed to be delivered as an hour lecture and lab demonstration, with approximately two hours of lab exercises. The instructor may choose to cover as many of these sections as they feel are required, or possible in the time permitted. They may also cover the module content in a different order, skip, or add new content to better customize the module to your needs. Therefore, the length and content of the module may vary.

## Adapting this Module

All of this content is provided for instructors to use, adapt, and remix for their own modules. Please note that this use does come with some legal caveats, explained in [About this Document](/Integration0About/0.00.AboutThisDocument.md).

If you wish to change the content of the manual, you can fork the [GitHub repository](). The manual is created using the [Gitbook toolchain](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/) and is written in easily editable [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). [Detailed instructions on adapting this content]() are also available.

Some suggestions for adaptation:
- Localize the exercise data to your country or city. A list of open data portals is available [here](https://www.opendatasoft.com/a-comprehensive-list-of-all-open-data-portals-around-the-world/).
  - If you do change the data, feel free to modify the [Module Resources](Integration0About\0.02.CourseResources.md) page.
- If it fits your course better, you could choose a single data integration scenario. If you prefer to grade close-ended questions, you could write those for one or more scenarios. You could also restrict the datasets or provide a data integration problem to solve rather then leaving it open for students to choose.
