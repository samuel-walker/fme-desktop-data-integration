## Introduction

In the previous exercises you have learned how to translate and transform data using FME. Now let's put that knowledge to use! As we covered in the [Lecture section](Integration1Lecture\1.00.Lecture.md), data integration is a key requirement for modern organizations. In this exercise you will develop a workspace that solves a data integration problem. There are three scenarios to choose from: business intelligence, city government, or web data. All three have the same requirements:
-inspect your data
-combine your datasets
-query your data to answer a question or solve a problem
-produce a deliverable and report showing your results

This exercise offers less guidance than the previous ones; you will have to explore FME for yourself in order to solve the problem. To get started, we will provide an example of integrating one dataset into a central database. After that you can follow similar steps for the remaining datasets. If you have trouble carrying out the steps you can refer to the FME Workbench Help (also available online in our [Documentation](https://support.safe.com/KnowledgeDocumentation)) or the community [Knowledge Center](https://knowledge.safe.com/).

## Exercise Goals

Your final challenge is to identify a possible problem based on your scenario and come up with a data integration solution.

You will have to explain the problem and solution you identified in a short report. Additionally, you must find a way to illustrate the benefits of your data integration solution by creating a deliverable: a map, table, or description of a new organizational process made possible by the solution. You can create this output using FME only (check out this [blog post for FME cartography tips](https://blog.safe.com/2017/12/cartography/) or this article on the [Mapnik Rasterizer](https://knowledge.safe.com/articles/1092/introduction-to-mapnikrasterizer.html)), or you can bring the data created in FME into another program, e.g. ArcGIS, Adobe Illustrator, GeoJSON (use Google Maps, Leaflet, Mapbox, etc.), Google Earth, Tableau, Qlik, QGIS, etc. If this software is not available to you, take a screenshot of the Data Inspector that shows your result.

Here are the scenarios:

Scenario|Problem
--|--
Business intelligence|You are a healthcare administrator with patient records describing length of hospital stay and other attributes. You also have data on the postcode where the patients live. Integrate this data with StatsCan demographic data to examine links between demographics, geography, and length of hospital stay. Produce a map and a chart or table showing your results.
City Government|The federal government has just announced a subsidy for building electric vehicle charging stations. The City of Vancouver Planning department has been tasked with identifying suitable locations for the stations. The city has money to build 4 stations; they must be on city-owned property; they must be near areas of high population density, they must be located near major intersections, and they must be spread out evenly. Integrate data to propose four locations.
Web-based data|You have developed a new application that generates a GeoJSON of recent killer whale sightings off the coast of Vancouver. However, you don't want a blank basemap under your data. Use FME to add some more data to your map and use it to find correlations with whale sightings. **Note:** this scenario lends itself to using [FME Server](https://www.safe.com/fme/fme-server/) for reading and writing data live. You can try to use this software if you have it available. Otherwise you can construct a workspace that generates a static map.

## Inspect Data**
To start off, inspect the data you have been given. There is a wide variety of topics and formats available. Following the instructions from [Exercise 3](Integration3LabExercises\3.04.Exercise3.md), open some of these files in the FME Data Inspector to see what attributes they have. Note that most data will make sense if the reader uses default values, but some formats need particular parameters set.

## Business Intelligence

## City Government

More data is available from the [City of Vancouver Open Data catalogue](http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/index.htm).

# Web-based Data

- Whale sightings (modeled from https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/distribution-of-killer-whales)
- 

<br>**1) Set Up Workspace**
The first step in any FME project is to set up your initial workspace. Choose one dataset you wish to use to create a reader and for your writer choose Esri Geodatabase. In this example we'll start with X.

# Outline
- Inspect Data
- Set Up Workspace
  - Generate
  - R/W parameters
  - Run
  - Inspect

# Notes
- Show point creation from xy
- Extra skills
  - Feature caching and partial runs
  - Merged versus individual feature types
    - fme_feature_type format attribute (good for merged feature types)

# Local government case using Vancouver data
- Addresses
- Boundaries
- Community Mapping (base?)
- Culture (public art)
- Elevation model (DEM)
- Emergency (all)
- Engineering
- Parcels
- Parks
- Planning
- Transportation
- Zoning
- Read Crime live? Could point to URL - maybe for all?

## Web-based formats/data
- JSON and GeoJSON
- Petra and Dean
