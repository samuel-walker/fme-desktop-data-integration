1|Think of an existing business, organization, or technology that relies heavily on data (e.g. [VRBO](https://www.vrbo.com/), the [United Nation Statistics Division](https://unstats.un.org/home/about/), or [autonomous cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car)). What kind of data sources might it need to integrate? Describe three data sources, their formats, and what information they provide. How would data integration in this example relate to one of the nine reasons to integrate your data covered in the lecture?
2|What is spatial ETL?
3|In the terminology of FME, what is the difference between a *translation* and a *transformation*?

Best practice is defined by Merriam-Webster as “a procedure that has been shown by research and experience to produce optimal results and that is established or proposed as a standard suitable for widespread adoption.”
Exercise 3|Complete the Advanced Exercise. What are the smallest, largest, and total park areas? What are the names of the smallest and largest parks? Don’t forget to include units. Where can you confirm the data’s units?

## Data Integration Scenario

Write a 200 word report on the data integration solution you created.
- Include the brainstorming diagram or outline you created before carrying out the walkthrough analysis. How close were you? What did you not anticipate?
- Which additional dataset did you use?
- What problem or question does your solution address?
- What analysis steps did you carry out?
- Provide a deliverable of some kind to show the value of your project. This could be a map (screenshot of Data Inspector is ok), a table, or a description of a new organizational process made possible by the solution.
