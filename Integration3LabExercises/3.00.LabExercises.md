# Lab Exercises

In this section of the modules, students will complete independent exercises using FME Workbench and FME Data Inspector. It is designed for students to complete in a lab with instructor supervision or on their own time as an assignment.

# Structure

The exercise section is made up of four sections. These sections are:

- Getting Started with FME Desktop
- Data Transformation
- Data Integration Scenario
- Lab Questions

The first section covers the basic functionality of FME Desktop. The second explores data transformation, including both structural and content transformation. The third section presents a real-world scenario requiring data integration. The fourth and final section contains **16** questions the instructor can use for grading students' completion of the exercises.

# Learning Objectives

Students will gain the ability to...

1. Open a workspace in FME Workbench and run it
2. Start FME Workbench and set up a quick translation
3. Start the FME Data Inspector, and to open and add datasets
4. Navigate a dataset and to query features within it
5. Control Data Inspector symbology and display characteristics
6. Set background maps in the Data Inspector
7. Edit a writer schema
8. Restructure data by mapping a reader to a writer schema, both manually and through transformers
9. Locate transformers in Workbench and use them to transform data content
10. Set transformer parameters in either the Parameter Editor or transformer dialogs
11. Define feature groups using the Group-By option
12. Reproject data using Workbench
13. Independently use FME to solve data integration issues in a real-world scenario. <!-- Might need to update --!>
