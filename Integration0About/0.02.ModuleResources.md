# Module Resources

A number of sample datasets and workspaces will be used in this module.

The data used in this training module is based on open data from the City of Vancouver, Canada.

Most exercises ask you to assume the role of a city planner at the fictional city of Interopolis and to solve a particular problem using this data.

You can [download the data for the module in a zip file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData2018.zip). We recommend extracting it to C:\FMEData2018.
