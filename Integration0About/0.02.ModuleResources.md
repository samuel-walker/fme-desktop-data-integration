## Module Data

A number of sample datasets and workspaces will be used in this module.

The data used in this training module is based on [open data](http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/index.htm) from the City of Vancouver, Canada.

Most exercises ask you to assume the role of a city planner at the fictional city of Interopolis and to solve a particular problem using this data.

You can [download the data for the module in a zip file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData2018.zip). We recommend extracting it to C:\FMEData2018.
