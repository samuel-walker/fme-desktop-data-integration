Here are the scenarios:

Scenario|Problem
--|--
Business intelligence|You are a healthcare administrator with patient records describing length of hospital stay and other attributes. You also have data on the postcode where the patients live. Integrate this data with StatsCan demographic data to examine links between demographics, geography, and length of hospital stay. Produce a map and a chart or table showing your results.
City Government|The federal government has just announced a subsidy for building electric vehicle charging stations. The City of Vancouver Planning department has been tasked with identifying suitable locations for the stations. The city has money to build 4 stations; they must be on city-owned property; they must be near areas of high population density; they must be located near major intersections; and they must be spread out evenly. Integrate data to propose four locations.
Web-based data|You have developed a new application that generates a GeoJSON of recent killer whale sightings off the coast of Vancouver. However, you don't want a blank basemap under your data. Use FME to add some more data to your map and use it to find correlations with whale sightings. **Note:** this scenario lends itself to using [FME Server](https://www.safe.com/fme/fme-server/) for reading and writing data live. You can try to use this software if you have it available. Otherwise you can construct a workspace that generates a static map.
