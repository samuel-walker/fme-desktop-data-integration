## Adding Transformers to the Canvas

You can add a transformer to the canvas in two ways.

### Transformer Gallery

As discussed earlier, the Transformer Gallery window allows you to browse all your transformers. They are organized by category. This method is useful if you are not quite sure which transformer you need, as you can expand the categories and look for the one you need.

The [Transformer Gallery](https://www.safe.com/transformers) is also available online, where you can also view related transformers and sort by the most used transformers.

### Add Transformer or Quick Add

You can add a transformer to your canvas by clicking Transformers > Add Transformers (keyboard shortcut <kbd>/</kbd>). This opens a search box on your canvas where you can start to type the name of your transformer and view your options.

You can also open this search box by clicking on a blank spot of your canvas and beginning to type. This functionality is called Quick Add.
