## Data Translation

FME can both translate and transform data.

At its heart, FME is a data translation tool, and this is usually the first aspect users wish to learn about.

Data translation consists of taking data in one format and translating it into another format. For example, taking a Word document (.docx file format) and turning it into a Portable Document Format (.pdf). Ideally, the process of data translation will preserve all or as much information from the source data as possible.

Incompatible data formats are a major barrier to moving data between systems. FMEâ€™s data translation or conversion capabilities ensure data can be used effectively in many applications.

## Data Transformation

FME also can change or transform your data. For example, maybe you want to remove references to a list of confidential names as you translate your data from .docx to .pdf. Or, to draw on the earlier example, maybe you want to get an email or SMS alert every time a new business license is added to the city database in a certain neighborhood. You can do this using data transformation.
